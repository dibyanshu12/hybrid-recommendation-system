in this project I have created a hybrid recommendation system which has both content as well as collaborative filtering.I have also taken into account the cold start problem(moostly uses content filtering in that regards) and tried to overcome that. 

#basic dependecies
1)Install scikit-surprise package
2)install all the other dependencies like numpy,itertool etc

#how to run the project
